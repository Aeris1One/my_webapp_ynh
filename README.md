Custom Webapp
-------------

Empty application with SFTP access to the Web directory.

## Overview

This application allows you to easily install a custom Web application,
providing files access with SFTP. It can also create a MySQL database
which will be backed up and restored if your application. The connection
details will be stored in the file `db_accesss.txt` located at the root
directory.

Once installed, go to the chosen URL to know the user, domain and port
you will have to use for the SFTP access. Under the Web directory, you
will have a `www` folder which is the public and served one. You can
put all the files of your custom Web application inside.

## Upgrade

Due to the SFTP access change, the upgrade can not be done from the last
`my_webapp` application - provided with YunoHost 2.2. You will have to remove
it first and install this new one, taking care of migrating your Web
application.

### Save your files and database

You will have to save the content of the `/var/www/my_webapp/files`
directory, either from the Web admin interface provided with the old app,
connecting to your server using SSH or SFTP as `admin`.

If you've created a MySQL database, you can also migrate it since the new
version allows to manage it for you. To create a dump, you could use
*phpMyAdmin* or connect to your server and execute:
`mysqldump -u root -p$(cat /etc/yunohost/password --no-create-db "$dbname" > ./dump.sql`
(do not forget to replace `$dbname` by your database name).

### Restore your custom Webapp

When you've take care of save your files - and optionally your database,
you can remove the app and install this new one. You can set the same
settings as the previous installation.

To restore your files, connect to the Web directory using the SFTP account
and put everything into the `www` directory.

If you have chosen to migrate your database too, open the file `db_access.txt`
to know the new database, user and password you will have to set in your app
configuration. You can either restore the dump using *phpMyAdmin* or connect
to your server and execute:
`mysql -u "$dbuser" -p"$dbpass" "$dbname" < ./dump.sql`
(do not forget to replace `$dbuser`, `$dbpass` and `$dbname` with the values
given in the file).
