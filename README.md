Custom Webapp
-------------

Empty application with SFTP access to the Web directory.

It can also create a MySQL database. In that case, the connection details
will be stored in the file `db_accesss.txt` located in the root folder of
the SFTP user.

## TODO

 * Update `upgrade` script and manage upgrading from current official app
